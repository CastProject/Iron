# Iron
A Package Manager for Cast

## Notice
This software is very early stage. It is recommended that you avoid using Iron
for any kind of production use at this time. It is likely that packages will
experience breaking changes (along with the package manager itself) due to how
new the package manager is and the likelihood of its requirements changing
over time.

## Indev
Iron is currently indev. It will be a package manager, but for now, I want to
hold off from documenting functionality until I actually have it implemented.
So, this README will be a bit sparse until functionality is actually added.

## License
Like the rest of the Cast project, **Iron** is licensed under the MIT License.
